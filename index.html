        <p>Master chief petty officer John-117, or "Master Chief", is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Halo multimedia franchise. Master Chief is a playable character in the series of science fiction first-person shooter video games Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians and Halo Infinite. I like him because I think he is completely cool. I also like playing halo 3 which includes him and overrall I love his story. he is part of a group of genetically augmented and highly trained super soldiers called SPARTAN. he is a SPARTAN II, the most powerful SPARTANs.</p>
